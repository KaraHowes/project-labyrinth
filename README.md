# Project Labyrinth

This is a pair-project built by Lena Simma and Kara Howes. We have built a Labyrinth game which fetches data from an API and stores the data in a global state.


## The problem

We started the project by making two reducers; one for the labyrinth data and one for the ui. Witihn the labyrinth reducer we built several reducers, which are methods to update the global store. We built two Thunks to handle the asynchrous code associated with API posts and also show a loader to handle the waiting time.

We used styled components to style the project. If we had more time, we would've liked to use more resuable components and would've structured the project differently - perhaps we included too much functionality in Game component.

We used React, Redux, Styled components and Lottie Animations.

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
